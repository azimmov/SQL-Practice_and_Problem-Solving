# SQL-Practice_and_Problem-Solving
This repository documents my ongoing progress in learning and improving SQL (Microsoft SQL Server) through structured problem-solving.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to demonstrate steady improvement in SQL by:
- Solving progressively harder SQL tasks
- Applying core SQL concepts in realistic scenarios
- Writing readable, well-structured queries with comments and explanations

The focus is on **thinking in SQL**, not just producing answers.

## Repository Structure

- **WorkingFile.csv**  
  Main dataset used for all tasks and queries.

- **data_dictionary.xlsx**  
  Definitions and descriptions for each column in the dataset.

- **Tasks.sql**  
  A collection of SQL tasks (without solutions), ranging from easy to very hard.

- **Queries.sql**  
  Solutions to all tasks (21 total), including:
  - Multiple approaches where relevant  
  - Intermediate steps for complex logic  
  - Personal notes and comments  
  - Occasional alternative solutions for comparison

- **README.md**  
  Project overview and documentation.

## Topics Covered

Across the tasks, the following SQL concepts are practiced:

- Aggregations and grouping
- Date and time functions
- String and numeric functions
- NULL handling
- CASE expressions
- Self-joins and relational reasoning
- Set operators (EXCEPT / INTERSECT)
- Ranking and top-N logic without window functions
- Trend and behavioral analysis
- Real-world business-style constraints

## Notes

- Window functions are intentionally avoided in harder tasks to strengthen foundational SQL reasoning.
- Some tasks include multiple attempts or refactors to reflect the learning process.
- The project is designed as a **learning log**, not a polished production solution set.

## How to Use

1. Review **Tasks.sql** to attempt the problems yourself.
2. Compare your approach with **Queries.sql**.
3. Use **data_dictionary.xlsx** to understand the schema and column meanings.

This repository will continue to evolve as I learn and practice more advanced SQL concepts.
